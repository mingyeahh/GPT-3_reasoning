Making tea can be a very relaxing hobby. Just a small correction, instead of saying \"make tea\", it would be better to say \"making tea\" since \"making\" is the correct verb form.

For example, you might say that a math problem is difficult to solve, but a workout is hard to complete. In general, \"difficult\" is a more formal word, while \"hard\" is more informal. However, in many cases, both words can be used interchangeably without changing the meaning of the sentence.","time":1682274996},{"sender":"user","msg":"But I feel like we should use hard here then?","time":1682275041},{"sender":"assistant","msg":"Yes, you could also use \"hard\" in this context without changing the meaning of the sentence.

Science fiction movies like The Matrix are very popular and can be very entertaining.

I'm glad to hear that you were able to stay with your cousins during the lockdown. Just a few corrections: instead of saying \"the national lock-down\", it would be better to say \"the lockdown\" since it's clear from the context that you are referring to the national lockdown. Also, instead of saying \"ended up statying\", it would be better to say \"ended up staying\" since \"staying\" is the correct verb form to use in this context. So the corrected sentence would be: \"Yes, I lived there during the lockdown.
